# Vastaamo: An Analysis on Data Privacy

On the client’s request; below lies a data privacy and security analysis of the Finnish Vastaamo case concerning the client's proposed business and their considerations of the risks of centralised digital platforms in the healthcare industry today.

### Context of the Case 
Healthcare now offers a wide range of attack opportunities that hold long-term value for cyber criminals as online platforms become a target for ransomware and extortion. (Schneider & Wirth, 2021) The sheer amount of data and it’s wide-scale utilisation affects the lives of all stakeholders by the digitisation of healthcare systems that have made sensitive patient and personal data and services more vulnerable by the day. (Kortesoja, 2022)
The Finnish DPA fined the psychotherapy business Vastaamo 608, 000 Euro in violation of the GDPR. These breaches occurred in November 2018 and March 2019 during a hack by a third-party attacker known to the extorted victims as ‘RANSOM_MAN’ who proceeded to blackmail Vastaamo and 15 000 of its patients on the release of critical health and personal data in the anonymous Tor network (Marttila, 2021). Declared bankrupt by the District Court of Helsinki in February 2021, this case is a stand-out warning of the importance of data security in the healthcare sector. Approx 36 000 patient records were breached causing immeasurable damage that will continue into the foreseeable future. 

Vastaamo failed to report the initial breaches until 2020 when the CEO hired Nixu Security to conduct an internal technical investigation. Nixu discovered the centralised patient database had been breached with a root username from a US IP address. A blackmail message on the accessible server was later discovered to be read by Vastaamo software developers responsible for server and firewall security and deleted in 2019. 
Advice was given to the victims on how to respond to any ransom messages or emails that they received and how to mitigate fall out of personal identity theft along with support help lines and Vastaamo offered free counseling sessions to patients. (Vastaamo, 2020). 
‘Failure to properly secure the processing of personal data and failure to report a security breach’ (Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto (Finland), 2021) landed Vastaamo with a slew of GDPR violations and compensation and damage claims. 

### Analysis and Implications  
#### Security and Privacy Failures: Root Causes and Implications
#### Root Cause 1: Neglect of Data Protection by Vastaamo: 
The lack of consideration for patient safety and the egregious breach of privacy (Schneider & Wirth, 2021) Vastaamo caused between 2018 and 2020 with consequences still seen to this date, shows an incredible neglect of data protection by the entire organisation. 
This neglect first stemmed from organisational failures that allowed the in-house development of inadequate security systems. The centralised system stored records from patients of approximately 25 psychotherapy centres on an automated and easy to use system that was not anonymous and not encrypted. (Ralston, 2021)
Sami Kreskinen and Ilari Lind, in-house software developers responsible for Vastaamo’s servers and security, confessed post-breach that they had been involved in a security breach at a previous company involving the download of a database that contained the data of 20 000 Finnish companies. (Ralston, 2021) 
The implications of unskillful tech’s and a lack of cybersecurity culture unfortunately led to the exploitation of major vulnerabilities in Vastaamo’s servers, an access point used by the attackers to gain access and exhort both Vastaamo and 30,000 of it’s patients. Outdated software and internal server URL’s from public internet along with default admin access and lax security and data protection allowed the inevitable bankruptcy and the uncalculable fallout for all stakeholders and victims involved. (Marttila, 2021)

#### Root Cause 2: Insufficient Guidelines and Auditing by Governing Bodies: 
The datification of health infrastructures and the vulnerability of critical health data have put governing bodies into overdrive, however, in Finlands self-classified data class system at the time of the Vastaamo breach, there seemed to be insufficient auditing and monitoring of patient information systems. Class A systems were required to be audited by external security companies, Class B were simply under supervision by governing bodies and were considered self-monitoring. (Kortesoja, 2022) 
Without regular audits, it seems such a successful business model like Vastaamo and it’s neglect of data privacy protection law is only highlighted when something fails, like Vastaamo’s breach. (Kortesoja, 2022) The fallout from the breach and impact on all stakeholders involved in this case will be remembered worldwide as a warning for lax data protection in the healthcare industry. 

#### Implications for Stakeholders 
Vastaamo and it’s investors have suffered immense damage, involving bankruptcy and legislative fines along with an irreparable reputation. The CEO was fired for withholding the data breaches and held liable for the damages by acting against their duty of care. (Marttila, 2021) CEO Tapio’s family assets were held to cover victim compensation, other employees are also under investigation.  
Vastaamo was also a subcontractor to several major public sector hospitals and employed about 300 psychotherapists. (Lindroos, 2020) The personal data of the therapists was also leaked to a potentially career-damaging level.  
Finlands reputation as a pioneer in digital health since the late 1990’s has been damaged in the eyes of the world. Their innovation in the national health data repository ‘Kanta’ which stores patients health and treatment records to allow accessibility and ease of use nation wide allows patients and health practitioners to coordinate health care securely. (Ralston, 2021) This system along with their Class A and Class B data monitoring structure has been held under scrutiny for its centralised nature and its inefficiency in conducting successful audits to avoid misconduct among businesses. 
Unable to mitigate their own stolen data due to Vastaamo's neglect to report the breaches promptly, the victims of this case were left exposed. Personal, sensitive data published on the Tor network left victims exposed to fraud, identity theft, and exposure of sensitive therapy notes. (Ralston, 2020) With this data still unrecovered, and being exposed online for an extended amount of time due to lack of breach notifications, the fallout of damage is difficult to measure. Not only does this affect the individual and their right to privacy but the victim's families due to the sensitive nature of the digitised therapy session notes. This breach spurred Finland to rush legislation that allows individuals to receive new social security numbers in the event of a breach of privacy of this nature. 

#### Privacy implications of systems and processes 
Failure to upgrade Vastaamo’s digitised system to meet new Class standard laws that specified secure digital connections to Kantas health register. Organisations were given several years to adopt the Class A or B system, however, Vastaamo CEO maintained that the government gave no specific guidelines on how to format their data for connection to Kanta, so instead Vastaamo registered a Class B system, for smaller businesses that still maintained mostly analogue file formats. When more data guidelines came out to help companies adopt the Class A, more secure system, Vastaamo still stayed in Class B. (Ralston, 2021) A single government official was responsible for the auditing of 280 Class B systems at the time, Vastaamo fell through the cracks. 
The privacy implications of Vastaamo's negligent security systems and processes inevitably resulted in long-term damage to all stakeholder's reputations and personal privacy security. Vastaamos database was online for download publicly for a short amount of time, the implications of that critical and personal data being in the hands of criminals will cause damage to innumerable individuals and their right to anonymity. Vastaamo failed in the protection of individual privacy via security, encryption and providing anonymous storage of data. 

### Assessment of Regulatory and Legislative Ramifications
Vastaamo is a clear demonstration that many IT and security systems in the health sector lack the skill and resources to provide secure, anonymous and encrypted data throughout its lifecycle. (Tuttle, 2021) Unfortunately, this leaves the healthcare sector extremely vulnerable due to the critical and sensitive nature of its stored data. 
Vastaamo breached multiple Articles of data protection law including: ‘notification of data breaches to the DPA’,  ‘communication of data breaches to data subjects’ and a failure to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, Vastaamo failed all stakeholders resulting in a notice of “Termination of Private Health Care Services”. (Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto (Finland), 2021). 
During the case investigation, the data protection impact assessments did not meet the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation, namely inadequate security of personal data. Vastaamo’s breach falls under the GDPR and the Finnish National Data Protection Act for investigation and prosecution rather than Criminal Law. Fines for the 3 articles listed above considered the nature of the data leaked, the subjects involved and the damage and fall out from the breach. Vastaamo falls into a sensitive and personal data breach, the number of victims potentially affected is among 15 000. (Lindroos, 2020) Fines for Vastaamo exceed 608 000 Euro due to the nature of the data along with compensation and damage claims for the victims. 

Valvira, responsible for health and welfare in Finland, stated that the appropriate security adjustments have now been made within Vastaamo along with its new CEO ensuring the current security of its current databases. (Ralston, 2020)
With such a complex case and the issuing of compensation and fines, this case sparked a global discussion on appropriate legislation and auditing within critical healthcare online platform security and has demonstrated the results of negligent data protection in regard to private patient data. Regulatory oversight and legislation changes stemming from the Vastaamo case need continuous research and updates and resources to assist with the growing risk of appropriate healthcare data protection. Conclusively, Vastaamo’s legislative repercussions stemmed from an unlawful processing and storage of critical and private patient data. 
An Australian enterprise similar to Vastaamo would face similar legislative repercussions should a breach of this nature occur. Such as: 
- Irreparable reputation damage for the organisation and investors. 
- Criminal liability and fines such as failure of breach notifications. 
- Security investigations and audits. 
- Damages due to failure to adhere to data protection laws and regulations as set out in the Privacy Act 1988. 

### Recommendations for an Australian Enterprise
For a similar healthcare platform to be successful in Australia, the following security advice is recommended to put patient privacy and security at the forefront: 
Develop a team and a culture of cyber security professionals that have a critical understanding of the creation, storage and archiving of sensitive data. Practically, a partnership between security educated clinicians and cybersecurity employees should identify an individual or individuals that lead the business in matters of both patient safety, data protection/privacy and cybersecurity. (Schneider & Wirth, 2021)
Be prepared for a cyber attack and be able to mitigate the fallout with a trained team of professionals. Understand the legislation and the company's responsibility towards data protection and an individual's right to privacy. 
Consider decentralised privacy preserving data storage and access. The automation of patient data access must not be prioritised over data protection. (Kortesoja, 2022)

#### Conclusion
Vastaamos staff and services were transferred to the occupational welfare service, Verve. Verve uses a Class A system connected to the government healthcare system Kanta. Although digital health platforms offer centralised storage of data in the form of patient databases etc., its supervision and automation must be formalised within data regulation and privacy guidelines and legislation and appropriate stakeholders must hold themselves accountable for the anonymity and encryption of all sensitive data. Conclusively a business proposal similar to Vastaamos can indeed form societal good in accessible healthcare support, however, a deep understanding of data protection and privacy must be at the core of this new business enterprise.
